    <div>Theresia St.Vrain</div>
      <p>A Columbia jeweler and metalsmith, Theresia St. Vrain is the owner and operator of St. Vrain Metals. Aesthetically, she emphasizes clean lines and refuses to be reliant on mass production. She makes a variety of jewelry, including necklaces, rings, and bracelets, as well as "vessels," a small handmade bowl.</p>

    <div>Jared W. Van Cleve</div>
      <p>Landscapes and other forms of nature inspire this artist. By using a variety of intense colors, Van Cleve tries to create a striking interpretation of the landscape that emotionally impacts the viewer. In his opinion, a painting should be "done right the first time." He doesn't do any reworking or blending.</p>
