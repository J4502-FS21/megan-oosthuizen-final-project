<h1 id="experience">Experience art in your own backyard</h1>
<p id="projectdes">You might think that Mid-Missouri isn't much of a cultural and artistic hotspot, but you'd be wrong. Mid-Missouri is filled with creatives who are creating some of the most innovative and inspiring things imaginable. My goal is to share my love of art and the importance of supporting local artists through this website, as well as highlight some of the best galleries and artists in Mid-Missouri! By supporting local arts and culture, you can expose your community to new ideas and perspectives. Additionally, you can advocate for those whose voices would not be heard if their art could not be expressed.</p>
